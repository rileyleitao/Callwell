          How Many Calls Is Your Business Missing After Hours? (And How Much Revenue That Costs You)

          Most service businesses don't realize how many calls they miss — because missed calls don't show up on the books. They just quietly disappear.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're a plumber, electrician, dental office, or clinic, missing calls often means missing jobs. And unlike other business problems, this one is invisible until you start measuring it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Real Cost of a Missed Call</h2>
        
        <p>Let's do some quick math that might surprise you:</p>
        
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-6">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>Average service call value:</strong> $150–$400</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>If you miss just 2 calls per day:</strong> 2 × $250 × 20 workdays = <strong>$10,000/month</strong></span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>After-hours and peak-time calls</strong> are typically higher intent than daytime calls — these callers need help now</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That's $120,000 per year walking out the door. And most business owners have no idea it's happening.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Why Calls Go Unanswered</h2>
        
        <p>It's not that you don't care about answering the phone. It's that running a service business makes it nearly impossible to catch every call:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2 my-6">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>After-hours:</strong> Someone's water heater explodes at 9 PM. Your phone rings. No one answers.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>Lunch breaks:</strong> Even a 30-minute break means missed opportunities.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>Technicians in the field:</strong> Your best people are doing the work, not answering phones.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>Front desk overloaded:</strong> When 3 calls come in at once, 2 go to voicemail.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="text-blue-600 mr-2">•</span>
            <span><strong>Staff burnout:</strong> High turnover means inconsistent coverage.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Why Voicemail Doesn't Work</h2>
        
        <p>
          "They'll just leave a message" is what most business owners think. But the data tells a different story:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
          <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">60–80% of callers won't leave a voicemail</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">They'll hang up and call the next business on Google. Your competitor answers. They get the job.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          In the age of instant everything, voicemail feels like a dead end to customers. They want help now, not a callback "sometime today."
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Modern Fix (Without Hiring Staff)</h2>
        
        <p>
          The good news? You don't need to hire a receptionist or pay for an expensive call center. AI-powered call handling has changed the game.
        </p>

        <p>Here's what modern AI call answering does:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2 my-6">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <CheckIcon class="h-5 w-5 text-green-500 mr-2 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />
            <span><strong>Answers instantly</strong> — no rings, no hold music, no voicemail</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <CheckIcon class="h-5 w-5 text-green-500 mr-2 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />
            <span><strong>Books appointments</strong> — directly into your calendar while the customer is on the phone</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <CheckIcon class="h-5 w-5 text-green-500 mr-2 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />
            <span><strong>Handles reschedules</strong> — customers can change appointments without playing phone tag</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <CheckIcon class="h-5 w-5 text-green-500 mr-2 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />
            <span><strong>Escalates emergencies</strong> — burst pipes and no-heat calls go straight to your on-call team</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's like having a receptionist who never sleeps, never takes breaks, and never gets overwhelmed when the phone rings off the hook.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-6 my-10">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-900">
            <strong>If your phone rings when no one's available, Callwell answers it — and books the job.</strong>
